# SPFFH
 SPFFH is a hybrid of two models on the concept of self-organized criticality, a physics model that is used to represent models that progress consistently until a certain variable becomes what is called a critical point. After one piece of the entire structure reaches a critical point, it creates an "avalanche-like" effect that topples over to other surrounding variables.

For example, a sandpile with grains of sand being poured consistently on it is a typical example of self-organized criticality. It slowly builds up until it reaches a point to where an avalanche (a drastic change of events) must occur for the physical system to maintain equilibrium. A forest fire is another good example, where a forest gradually grows in size until the chance of a strike of lightning hitting a tree in the area becomes probable. Once lighting successfully strikes, the result will be a fire spreading throughout the forest and burning a large chain of trees.

SPFFH stands for Sand Pile Forest Fire Hybrid, and vizualizes a fusion of the two models. It takes the aspect on analog value as represented in the depth of a sandpile, and a critical point resulting in the instant change between a node being dead or alive as represented in the forest fire model. After making these changes it presents a new model that makes use of the rules that are present within self-organized criticality.
